  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <h3>Personal Project</h3>

  <h4>Wechat Mini Program</h4>
  <p>Allows users to record their training amount directly through wechat mini
  program</p>



  <h3>School Projects and Competition</h3>

  <h4>Trading S&P ETFs Using Gaussian Process Multi-macro Factor Model (Spring 2019)</h4>
  <p>Project for course <i>Optimization for Finance</i></p>

  <li>Applied machine learning methods to model the returns of ETFs with Fama-French factors and macroeconomic factors; performed factor selection on these factors </li>
  <li>Back-tested using Markovitz mean-variance model using exponential kernel and improved stability of portfolio wealth evolvement by adding more constraints</li>


  <h4>Econ Research Based on Water Usage - Citadel Datathon Competition (Fall 2018)</h4>
  <p><i>Citadel Datathon</i></p>

  <li>Performed data analysis with Python for economic research in U.S using water usage data (3.2k+ rows & 45 features) and earnings data (22k rows and 20 features) </li>
  <li>Applied machine learning models for relationship analysis, including linear regression, K-means, PCA</li>
  <li>Achieved <b>2nd</b> place in a team of 4 out of 26+ teams at the datathon held by Citadel and Citadel Securities </li>



  <h4>Housing Market Price Prediction (Fall 2018)</h4>
  <p>Project for course <i>Statistical Machine Learning</i></p>

  <li>Manipulated house related data (30.5k+ rows, 290+ features) with Python including removing missing data process (extrapolation), categorical data encoding (one hot encoding), feature scaling (normalization)</li>
  <li>Applied time series model such as autocorrelation, ARIMA to analyze seasonality changes in the housing prices</li>
  <li>Built machine learning models to predict house price including linear regression, PCR, random forest and XGBoost</li>
  <li>Optimized model based on cross-validation, hyperparameters tuning and evaluation metrics (MSE)</li>


  <h4>Insight UBC (Fall 2017)</h4>
  <p>Project for course <i>Introudction to Software Engineering</i></p>
  <li>Created a website using extensive JavaScript with a user-friendly UI,
      allowing users to import datasets containing UBC courses and query information</li>
  <li>Initiated efficient course searching and developed an automatic scheduling
    system</li>
  <li>Invented a room scheduler that assigns classes to classrooms matching room
    capacity and class size</li>

  <h4>Resource and Transportation Optimization Algorithm (Spring 2016)</h4>
  <p>Project for course <i>Introudction to Computer Systems</i></p>
  <li>Volunteered in the unisex public washroom project to support the transgender
      population </li>
  <li>Created a C program using multithreading, monitors (mutexes) and
      conditional variables and optimized thread scheduling, implementing on
      resource and transportation optimization</li>
  <li>Ensured no deadlock and the fairness for multiple threads entering the
      critical section with a reasonable waiting time by using conditional variables</li>

  <h2>Hobbies</h3>

  <h3>Tennis</h3>
  <p>I started playing tennis when I was 12. During my high school, I joined
  a tennis club and represented the school to play against other high
  schools. My current tennis level is around 4.0.</p>

  <h3>Table Tennis</h3>
  <p>I learnt how to play table tennis when I was 10. I still play table
  tennis from time to time with friends</p>

  <h3>Workout</h3>
  <p>I have been doing muscle training for about 2 years. My personal
  record: bench press(185lb), squat(275lb), deadlift(225lb)</p>

  <h3>Hiking</h3>
  <p>I did my undergrad study in Vancouver, a fantastic city with lots of beautify sceneries.</p>
