  <h4>Wechat Mini Program</h4>
  <p>Allows users to record their training amount directly through wechat mini
  program</p>

  <h3>School Projects</h3>

  <h4>Insight UBC</h4>
  <p>Project for course <i>Introudction to Software Engineering</i></p>
  <li>Created a website using extensive JavaScript with a user-friendly UI,
      allowing users to import datasets containing UBC courses and query information</li>
  <li>Initiated efficient course searching and developed an automatic scheduling
    system</li>
  <li>Invented a room scheduler that assigns classes to classrooms matching room
    capacity and class size</li>

  <h4>Resource and Transportation Optimization Algorithm</h4>
  <p>Project for course <i>Introudction to Computer Systems</i></p>
  <li>Volunteered in the unisex public washroom project to support the transgender
      population </li>
  <li>Created a C program using multithreading, monitors (mutexes) and
      conditional variables and optimized thread scheduling, implementing on
      resource and transportation optimization</li>
  <li>Ensured no deadlock and the fairness for multiple threads entering the
      critical section with a reasonable waiting time by using conditional variables</li>
